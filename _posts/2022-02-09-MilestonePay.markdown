<br>
<p>MilestonePay, a web application, is used by freelancers and clients as a platform to work together. The existing system has the capability to generate contracts using pre-built templates. The contract includes deliverables and payment information. <br>
  <br> MilestonePay wanted to offer clients more support which would help both the clients and freelancers be happy. <br>
  <br> Academy Xi Transform team was approached to create a tool that would automate the transactions to help manage the sales process. <br>
  <br> The tool which we created as a team has an end-to-end flow of onboarding the clients, creating proposals, creating contracts, scheduling a meeting with the client, managing invoices. <br>

    <h4>
      <b>Client Brief</b>
    </h4>
    <br>
    <p>The purpose of this project is to build a tool to help our users (Freelancers and Small Business Owners) create a workflow for their customers to seamlessly automate their interactions, increase customer communication and satisfaction by reducing back of house operations (Invoicing, Document generation, Project management, etc.) and systemise their business in a quick and easy way.</p>

    <h4>
      <b>Initial Problem Statement</b>
    </h4>
    <br>
    <p>Freelancers who feel unmotivated and overwhelmed about the admin process of running a small business - need to seamlessly onboard, service and invoice their clients, but don't have a lot of time and don't know where to begin.</p>
    <br>
    <hr style="border-top-color:#8d579c;">
    <h4>
      <b>RESEARCH PLAN</b>
    </h4>
    <br>
    <p>Three types of research techniques were used. Click through the tabs below for more details about each of the research technique.</p>

    <p>We then started with Desktop Research to understand the users, and we learned that there are roughly 4.1million freelancers in Australia of whom 40% reported feeling time-poor. 31% also said they would like to learn about how to automate their business. <br>
      <br>So if they aren't using MilestonePay already, what kind of tools are they using? <br>
      <br>We did some competitor analysis to understand the landscape and performed a SWOT analysis on 4 of the top competitors that you can look through later. <br>
      <br>They are as below:</p>

      <p>We considered MilestonePay's value proposition, asking: what makes it stand out against its competitors, and what do the users value about it? <br><br>Its present values are that it's an Australian Platform and has a free tier, making it feel more accessible and it is built for the humble freelancer rather than large corporations. The Milestone Pay option also helps users get paid with less friction.<br><br>We also looked at how Milestone would stand out in the future, with a more user-friendly platform and substantial level of automation.</p>

      <br>
      <p>We received 26 responses across 2 surveys. Questions ranged from the "tell us about your business development process" to "how do you manage scope creep", "have you ever had trouble getting paid" and "do you regularly ask for feedback"?</p>

  <div id="qualitative2" class="tab-pane fade">
      <br>
      <p>We sat for 1:1 interviews with 8 freelancers and 6 clients. We asked them about their experiences with business administration, but mostly we asked about their pain points. What support did they need? How could we make their lives easier?</p>
